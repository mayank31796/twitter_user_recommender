Looks good. For evaluation, note that the list of friends of a user are sorted in the order in which they were added. So, I believe the first friends listed were the most recent to be followed (need to check this). Thus, for evaluation, you could try to predict those final ones.

Note also that the rate limits for collecting social network information are pretty strict, so you have to be clever with how you collect the data.
