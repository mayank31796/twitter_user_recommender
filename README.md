# twitter_user_recommender
The project is a user recommendation model for twitter users. The project uses Social Network Mining and topic modeling techniques to create a topic model (TM1) for a primary user U1. Similar topic models are made for other users and they are then compared with our primary user's (U1) topic model (TM1) using Jensen Shannon divergence to rank users based on similarity.
